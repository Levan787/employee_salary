# employee_salary

I wrote code that show salary statistics for 6 employees in family restaurant. 
According to information owner has the highest salary-15000$ and 60% monthly profit, 
each chef gets 10000$ and 20% monthly profit and waiters gets 3000$ and tips. 
I divided each employees by names, ID and salary.
